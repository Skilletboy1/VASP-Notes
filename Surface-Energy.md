# Surface Energy Calculation

## Description
E=(ESLAB-7*EBULK)/2

Slab should be a TM(111)-1x1 Seven Layer Surface

## Steps
>> 1. Optimize bulk system
>> 2. Make slab surface and run geometry optimization

## What is Surface Energy
Energy it takes to create a surface, disruption of intermolecular bonds
